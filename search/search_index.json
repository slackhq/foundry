Gradle has extremely limited configurability for the Gradle daemon, and we want to optimize the JDK for available space on different developer machines. To support this, we compute optimal daemon jvm arguments in bootstrap and write them to the user\u2019s home <code>~/.gradle/gradle.properties</code> to override repo-specific settings with client-side properties.</p> <p>For the JDK, it requests the JDK toolchain from Gradle\u2019s first-party APIs. This includes allowing Gradle to download the JDK if it\u2019s missing, which is useful for getting developers set up and running faster.</p> <p>Bootstrap is also useful on CI for its ability to scale available memory to the machine it\u2019s running on, so we generally run it as a preflight step for all of our CI jobs too.</p> <p>Finally, there are some other specific things it does to optimize things:</p> <ul> <li>Disable Gradle file watching on CI as it\u2019s not necessary there.</li> <li>Configure specific GC and heap args for optimized use in Gradle builds (favoring larger young generation spaces).</li> <li>Configure a fixed-size heap for CI to avoid time spent growing the heap.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"platforms/gradle/configuration/","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"location":"platforms/gradle/dependency-rake/","title":"Dependency Rake","text":"<p>Dependency rake is an tool we develop within foundry (SGP) to automatically clean up Gradle build files.</p> <p>This tool uses the outputs of the dependency-analysis-gradle-plugin ( DAGP) to infer and apply fixes it recommends.</p>"},{"location":"platforms/gradle/dependency-rake/#types-of-fixes","title":"Types of Fixes","text":"<p>There are three main categories of fixes that DR applies.</p> <ol> <li>Remove unused dependencies.<ul> <li>Like it says on the tin, these are declared dependencies that are unused and should be removed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fix misused dependencies.<ul> <li>These are dependencies that are declared but only transitive dependencies they include are actually used.

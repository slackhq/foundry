/**
 * Represents a Skippy configuration for a specific [tool].
 *
 * @property buildUponDefaults Whether to build upon the default Skippy configuration.
 * @property includePatterns A set of glob patterns for files to include in computing affected
 *   projects. This should usually be source files, build files, gradle.properties files, and other
 *   projects that affect builds.
 * @property excludePatterns A set of glob patterns for files to exclude from computing affected
 *   projects. This is run _after_ [includePatterns] and can be useful for excluding files that
 *   would otherwise be included by an existing inclusion pattern.
 * @property neverSkipPatterns A set of glob patterns that, if matched with a file, indicate that
 *   nothing should be skipped and [AffectedProjectsComputer.compute] will return null. This is
 *   useful for globally-affecting things like root build files, `libs.versions.toml`, etc.
 *   **NOTE**: This list is always merged with [includePatterns] as these are implicitly relevant
 *   files.

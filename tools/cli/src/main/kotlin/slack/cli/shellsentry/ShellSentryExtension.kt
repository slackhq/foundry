/**
 * [ShellSentryExtension] is an extension API to bring your own, complex checkers to [ShellSentry].
 *
 * Extensions are given the command, exit code, and console output of the failed command. They can
 * then process it however they want and return an [AnalysisResult] if they find an issue.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Below is an example of an extension that asks an AI chat bot to diagnose a failure.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * public class AiExtension(private val aiClient: AiClient) : ShellSentryExtension {
 *   override fun check(command: String, exitCode: Int, isAfterRetry: Boolean, consoleOutput: Path): AnalysisResult? {
 *     val text = consoleOutput.readText()
 *     val rawAnalysis = aiClient.analyze(text)
 *     return rawAnalysis.toAnalysisResult()
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 */
public fun interface ShellSentryExtension {
  /**
   * Returns a result of this extension's analysis. Returns null if this extension could not handle
   * failure.
   *
   * @param command the command that was executed.
   * @param exitCode the exit code of the command. Guaranteed to be non-zero.
   * @param isAfterRetry whether this is after a retry.
   * @param consoleOutput the path to the console output of the command.
   * @see AnalysisResult for more details on what goes in a result.

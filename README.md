slack-gradle-plugin
===================

This repository contains the core Gradle plugin and associated logic used for Slack's Android app.

This repo is effectively _read-only_ and does not publish artifacts to Maven Central. We [develop
these in the open](https://slack.engineering/developing-in-the-open/) to knowledge-share with the community.

As such, our issue tracker is closed and we don't normally accept external PRs, but we welcome your
questions in the discussions section of the project!

We may later publish some of these components. If you're interested in this, feel free to raise in
a discussions post or vote for existing suggestions.

/**
 * Foundry dependencies! Please keep these in order:
 * - Properties before types
 * - Alphabetical order
 *
 * **NOTE:** This is _not_ where versions are defined! Those are defined in `gradle.properties`.
 * These definitions are solely just pointers to coordinate identifiers and the versions are
 * resolved via gradle properties at configuration time. Version keys are defined in the format of
 * either
 * * DependencySet member - `slack.dependencies.artifact-id-here=version-here`
 * * DependencyGroup member - `slack.dependencies.dependency-group-simple-name-here=version-here`
 *
 * These gradle properties can be customized at both the [DependencyGroup] constructor and
 * [artifact] function call levels. All properties are eventually prefixed with
 * `slack.dependencies.` under the hood, so there is no need to manually specify it here.
 *
 * The main entry point to define an artifact is via [artifact]. This can be depended on in
 * build.gradle (exposed as a [Notation] shorthand, which gradle dependencies can understand). Under
 * the hood this is backed by a delegate that contains a full [DependencyDef] that we can use for
 * further dependency analysis elsewhere.
 *
 * ```
 * val dependencyName: Any by artifact(...)
 * ```
 *
 * If added context is needed, you can add `withComments` as an infix function. These correspond to
 * Gradle's `because` semantic in dependencies.
 *
 * ```
 * val dependencyName: Any by artifact(...) withComments "This is why this is here!"
 * ```
 *
 * When declaring a set of unrelated dependencies, use [DependencySet].
 *
 * ```
 * object Name : DependencySet() {
 *   public val dependencyName: Any by artifact(group, artifact)
 *
 *   // If the property name can be used as the artifact name, you can just define the group
 *   public val gson: Any by artifact(group) // artifact name is implicitly 'gson'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When declaring a group of related dependencies, use [DependencyGroup].
 *
 * ```
 * object Name : DependencyGroup(group) {
 *   public val dependencyName: Any by artifact(artifact)
 *
 *   // Artifact can be implied here too
 *   public val gson: Any by artifact() // artifact name is implicitly 'gson'
 *
 *   // You can override specific values
 *   public val slightlyOdd: Any by artifact(groupOverride = "differentGroup")
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * For Android SDK 30, the real sources are not published until its release. This is annoying when
 * we want to build against them though (new APIs, etc). To cover for this, we copy over the
 * existing android-29 sources into the android-30 directory as temporary cover with a
 * `slack_patched_marker` file.
 *
 * Once real sources are published, this will just delete the copied jar and let AGP download it
 * automatically.

Skate Plugin
=========================

An Intellij plugin that helps to improve local developer productivity by surfacing useful information in the IDE.

We use this at Slack for several use cases:
* Announce updates, latest changes and improvements through "What's New" panel
* Annotate Feature Flag to help easily access its setup
* Generate API model translators when migrating legacy API
* Create initial new subproject setup from `File` dropdown

## Installation

#### Artifactory
1. Install `artifactory-authenticator` plugin from disk and authenticate with Artifactory
2. Add custom plugin repository link from "Manage Plugin Repositories"
3. Search "Skate" in the plugins marketplace and install it

#### Local testing
1. Build local version of the plugin with `./gradlew buildPlugin`
2. Open IDE settings, then "Install Plugin from Disk..."

## Implementation
All registered plugin actions can be found in `skate.xml` config file

## Tracing
We're sending analytics for almost all Skate features to track user usage. To set this up,
1. Register new feature event in `SkateTracingEvent`
2. Use `SkateSpanBuilder` to create the span for event you want to track
3. Make call to `SkateTraceReporter` to send up the traces

## Releasing
1. Update `change-notes.html` file under `skate-plugin/` and merge it to `main`
2. Run `publish-skate` Github Action.
Behind the scene the action's running`./gradlew :skate-plugin:uploadPluginToArtifactory`
